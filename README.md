My Little Botnet is a very simple tool that let's you execute python code on participating machines. 
This botnet does not have any ways of replicating itself. This is a personal project which involves 
"infecting" (manually adding to startup applications) a bunch of school computers, playing some
spooky sounds and deleting itself. But you can use it however you like.
